# dropzone
Drag and drop image -> pasteable base64 data URI

### What?
Dropzone is a simple html page that you can use to convert images to easily pasteable text. When you paste the text in comment boxes and websites it automagically converts to an image.

### I still don't get it

Ok, to put it in simple terms, this turns an image into a bunch of text that you can paste somewhere that doesn't allow you to post pictures. The need for this came to be when creating a new blog it was realized that imgur.com (a popular image host) does not allow VPN users to use their service. Having not a lot of familiarity with other hosts, the no-host solution was attempted, and it works :)


## what next?

go post images where you aren't supposed to. kidding, maybe we can make it a desktop app with tauri.
