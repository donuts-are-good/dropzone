### What?

Sometimes you want to post a picture, but imgur.com has blocked all of your vpn endpoints, what are you gonna do? Well, open this html file and drag an image onto it and it will convert that image into text that can be transformed back into a picture when the browser renders it. 


### I still don't get it

Ok, to put it in simple terms, this turns an image into a bunch of text that you can paste somewhere that doesn't allow you to post pictures. The need for this came to be when creating a new blog it was realized that imgur.com (a popular image host) does not allow VPN users to use their service. Having not a lot of familiarity with other hosts, the no-host solution was attempted, and it works :)


## what next?

go post images where you aren't supposed to. kidding, maybe we can make it a desktop app with tauri.
